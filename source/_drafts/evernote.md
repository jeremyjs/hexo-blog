I use Evernote for any notes that have pictures. Namely, I take pictures of all my clothes and keep them in Evernote. I also use it for tracking receipts. After I've captured the receipt I can throw it away. I used to use Evernote for everything, but have since switched to Workflowy and Google Docs for most text notes. I may migrate back to Evernote at some point.
