{% quote Elon Musk %}
I think it's very important to have a feedback loop, where you're constantly thinking about what you've done and how you could be doing it better.

I think that's the single best piece of advice: constantly think about how you could be doing things better and questioning yourself.

This post is a summary of [this wonderful post created by _Wait, but Why?_](https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/11/the-cook-and-the-chef-musks-secret-sauce.html)

Elon Musk thinks of the brain as a computer and human thoughts as the software. So why not improve the software?

Most of us are biologically inclined to follow authority and believe in common sense and the dogma of our tribes.

However, if these authorities are wrong, and we blindly follow them, we can't innovate.

You should take the approach that you’re probably wrong about most things, especially complicated things. Your goal is to be less wrong.

The Scientific Method is one way of thinking. It's been shown to work pretty well for reasoning about the real world.

Start with first principles. When you come up with a reason, follow [the chain of whys](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8idwyuVJ4ug).

Everything is a theory. You should test out theories, and update your beliefs based on the data you get back.

This is the basic software in your brain:

There are four basic components. Wants, reality, goals, and strategies.

Understanding what you want is difficult. You need a deep, honest, and independent understanding of yourself. Your wants will change over time. You should review often to make sure you still want the things you are trying to achieve.

The reality box represents your view of reality. Understanding reality means having the clearest possible factual picture of the world and your own abilities. You should continually educate yourself and keep informed about current events and the cutting edge of technology.

Goals are the set of wants that are also realistic. As you gain skills, build a track record, and expand your network, you will be able to attain bigger goals. If you have no money, no reputation, no connections, limited knowledge, or limited skills, your reality box isn't that big, and your goals are limited. You should focus on expanding the reality box and its list of “things that are possible” by increasing these resources.

Strategies are plans to achieve your goals. Create strategies based on what you know, not on what is typically done. Assume your first strategies are wrong. Test the shit out of them. Pay close attention to the results. Improve your strategy iteratively.

Finally, only fear things that are truly dangerous. For instance, it doesn't make sense to be afraid of starting a company. Starting a company isn't dangerous (if you do it right). The greatest risk should be that the company fails. Failing to build a company shouldn't bankrupt you.
