{% quote Dwight D. Eisenhower %}
Who can define for us with accuracy the difference between the long and short term! Especially whenever our affairs seem to be in crisis, we are almost compelled to give our first attention to the urgent present rather than to the important future.
{% endquote %}

#### From the Art of Manliness:

*Urgent* means that a task requires immediate attention. These are the to-do’s that shout “Now!” Urgent tasks put us in a reactive mode, one marked by a defensive, negative, hurried, and narrowly-focused mindset.

*Important* tasks are things that contribute to our long-term mission, values, and goals. Sometimes important tasks are also urgent, but typically they’re not. When we focus on important activities we operate in a responsive mode, which helps us remain calm, rational, and open to new opportunities.

Tasks are put in one of four quadrants:
- [I] Urgent & Important
- [II] Important
- [III] Urgent
- [VI] Neither

I'm working on a [system for prioritizing quadrant II tasks](/prioritizing).
