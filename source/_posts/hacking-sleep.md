I've tried different polyphasic sleep schedules in the past, but I will read the following links before making any decisions about my sleep schedule for this spring.

Until Jan 8th, I will be using a free-running sleep schedule. I will sleep when tired and awaken naturally (or if bothered by a distraction and feel like getting up).

In the past I've tried a biphasic sleep schedule where I take two core sleeps and one nap.
