This spring I'll be headed back to school so there's a lot on my plate.

I have to balance class, extracurriculars, partying, side projects, networking/job searching, self-improvement, exercise, sleep, and of course, whatever other events I can fit in my spare time.

There are several categories in my life that I've determined to prioritize in the following order:
- Sleep
- Exercise
- Daily Hygiene
- This Blog (Day Planning/Productivity)
- Class
- Contract Work (Hopefully)
- Networking/Job Hunting
- Epsilon Nu Tau
- Dunmo
- Stock Trading
- Studying CS Concepts (Interview Prep)
- Dating
- Other Side Projects
- Self-Improvement
- Alpha Chi Sigma
- Partying

This is roughly urgency-importance order.

Here's the master list of activities that I will need to plan into my scedule each day/week/month:
- Sleeping
- Exercising
- Daily Hygiene
- Household Chores
- Blogging (Daily/Weekly/Monthly Planning)
- Homework/Class Projects
- Lectures/Lab Sessions
- Studying for Class
- Contract Work (Hopefully)
- Networking/Job Hunting
- ENT Meetings
- ENT Duties
- Dunmo
- Stock Trading
- Interview Prep (Studying CS Concepts)
- Building "Attractiveness" (Self-Improvement, etc.)
- Meeting New People (Clubs, Events, Hanging with friends, etc.)
- Online Dating
- Dating
- Other Side Projects
- Self-Improvement (Other than building "attractiveness")
  - Nootropics
  - Mind Hacking
  - Productivity Hacking
  - Meta Learning Research
  - Other Reading/Learning
- Hanging with AXE People
- Other Partying
- Other Hanging with Friends
- Other (Watching TV, etc.)

I will now create an example week with a reasonable amount of time scheduled for each activity to see what I can realistically accomplish in a week. Since I plan to go to sleep between 10pm and midnight (or later on weekends), I consider sleep to be the first activity of the day.
