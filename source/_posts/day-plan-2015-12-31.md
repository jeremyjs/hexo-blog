Today marks the first day in my free-running sleep schedule. I slept last night from 7:30pm - 10:30pm and again from 4:00am - 10:00am.

I need to create a better system for doing [quadrant II tasks](/urgency-importance-matrix). For projects, I've decided to try the [100:10:1 method](/100-10-1). For other personal improvement, I'm not sure yet.

Today's theme is Spring Planning and my priorities are:
- Programming
  - Dunmo
  - 100:10:1
- Schedule dentist appointment
- Prepare for clothes shopping (review styles and such)
- Make a list of necessities for spring
- Sell old desktop pc
- Make a plan for spring semester
- Update resume and public profiles

Here's my rough agenda for the day.
