Today marks the third day in my free-running sleep schedule. It seems to have degenerated into sleeping once at night for ~9 hours. I slept last night from 2:00am - 11:00am. I'll continue it for a few more days, but if it appears to have settled by tuesday, I'll call this experiment done.

I still need to create a better system for doing [quadrant II tasks](/urgency-importance-matrix). Before class starts, I'd like to solidify my personal productivity system, even if it's very barebones. I will be iterating on it daily.

I should start tracking my "inbox processing" time in toggl to get a better idea of how long it actually takes on average.

Today's priorities are:
- Email grandparents about tuition payment
- Get new glasses
- Schedule dentist appointment
- Sell Oculus Rift DK2 on ebay
- Sell old desktop pc on ebay
- Solidify plan for heading to purdue
- Solidify personal productivity system
- Spring planning

Here's my rough agenda for the day.
