A goal is not always meant to be reached, it often serves simply as something to aim at.

Every day I like to make a plan of what I'll do for the day. I use Google Calendar for this. I use Workflowy and Dunmo to figure out what I need to do and which of those things should be done at some point today.

First thing in the morning, I will process my inbox.

Then I make a list of top priorities in Workflowy/Dunmo:
- Fires: anything urgent and important.
- Any priorities for this week.
- Next steps in line with [today's theme](/day-theming).

Finally, I just schedule every minute of my day with these top priorities.

I will also take a picture or screenshot of the schedule so that I can evaluate my success at the beginning of the next day's planning session.

I'll write everything up quick and post it to my blog to help keep me accountable and allow me to keep a record for later review.
