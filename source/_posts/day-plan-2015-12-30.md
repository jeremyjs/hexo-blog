This is my first [day plan](/day-planning). I had the idea while taking a shower. My schedule today according to Google Calendar has been:

As you can see I overslept today. From now until Jan. 8th I will no longer be attempting to use a biphasic schedule and will instead be using a [free-running sleep schedule](/hacking-sleep). I will also be researching sleep in an attempt for further optimization experiments in January.

I also spent 3.5 hours processing my inbox. This was because a) I didn't process yesterday and b) I have been having trouble with [going deep while processing my inbox](/inbox). While processing the inbox, each item should take 2 minutes at the most. Instead, I spent time reading articles or watching videos, which should have been scheduled separately.

Today's theme is *Professional Development*. My top priorities are:
- Schedule dentist appointment
- Dedicated practice (Programming)
- Create a Professional Development plan for this spring

#### Review:

I didn't do any of this stuff. Right after my nap, I felt like going for a walk. While walking, I listened to [this podcast with Derek Sivers](http://fourhourworkweek.com/2015/12/28/derek-sivers-reloaded-on-success-habits-and-billionaires-with-perfect-abs). Due to his intoxicating nature, I was then inspired to watch a bunch of his TED talks and videos on Youtube. All in all I gathered many nuggets, and I deem it useful time spent. I will eventually write a blog post about each person I consider an influence of mine, including Derek Sivers.
