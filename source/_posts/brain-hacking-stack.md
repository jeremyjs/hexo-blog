When solving problems, dig at the roots instead of just hacking at the leaves.

This post is all about my strategies and habits to improve my mental power and effectiveness.

## The Stack
- Sleep
- Bulletproof Diet
- Dual N-Back Training
- Concentration Training
- Exercise
- Supplements
- Nootropics

## Sleep
Step 1: Get a solid 8 hours of sleep in a totally dark room. The best way is to use earplugs and an eyemask. You can also take some sleep hacking supplements to help you fall asleep quicker and get better quality. Download the [Sleep Cycle app](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/sleep-cycle-alarm-clock/id320606217?mt=8) and start tracking. You can also track variables to see which tactics give you the best quality sleep.

Getting enough sleep is the #1 way to ensure you start at a good baseline to learn quickly and perform faster with more focus.

## Bulletproof Diet
Step 2: Eat food. Not too much. Mostly plants and some meat. Stay away from carbs. I follow the Bulletproof Diet which means I start my day around 7am with a Bulletproof Coffee. 8oz. organic coffee, 2 tbsp of Kerrygold grass-fed butter, and 2 tbsp of MCT oil. Healthy fats are good for your brain. Then I intermittent fast until 2pm. If I'm really hungry I'll have another BP coffee. Then I eat as much as I want of meat and vegetables, trying to get lots of different colors of veggies and eating 2:1 plants to meat. I try not to have any carbs or sugar. I can eat as much as I want until 8pm. Then I don't eat any food until 2pm the next day. [Here's the Bulletproof Diet Roadmap.](https://www.bulletproofexec.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/BPDRMrast-06112014.55436.pdf) If you follow that, you're golden.

## Dual N-Back Training
Step 3: Train your brain. Dual N-Back Training is the only brain game that's scientifically proven to have a significant effect on increasing your IQ.<sup>[1](#brain-hacking-footnotes)</sup> It works in two ways. It improves your working memory, which means you can juggle more concepts and thoughts at once. It also improves your executive functioning, which is your ability to stay focused on the current task and notice when you are getting distracted. I play the game for 20 mins every evening. I use [i9 Mindware](http://www.iqmindware.com/brain-training-apps/i9-desktop) which I paid for. You can also use [MindFlow](http://themindflow.com/flash.html), which is free, but doesn't track your progress for you and doesn't provide as much variety.

## Concentration Training
Step 4: Meditate. Concentration Training is a form of mindfulness meditation that involves either focus on a single point, mantra, or sensation in exclusion of all else. If you notice your focus drifting, you bring your attention back to the single point. Sounds easy, but is notoriously difficult for most, especially in our always-on push notification society. I really like the gitbook [Mind Hacking](http://www.mindhacki.ng/content/) which you can read online, and subscribe to the 21-day email course to get guided practice sessions. The 21-day course gives you a bunch of concentration training, and the book itself gives lots of cool strategies and tactics for intention and visualization mind hacking.

## Exercise
Step 5: Exercise. I have yet to do this because I'm busy and not exactly an exercise buff. I will most likely start by doing the 7 minute workout and jog a mile 3 times a week. I recommend HIIT to maximize brain performance.

## Supplements
Step 6: Take vitamins and supplements. I take some basic vitamins and supplements which help brain health: Magnesium, Vitamin D, Krill Oil (Salmon or other fish oil also works), Turmeric (Curcumin & Peperine), and a B-100 complex.

## Nootropics
Step 7: Finally, take nero-enhancers to compound your effects. If you want to compound your performance, you can also take nootropics to help your receptors fire faster and improve your nerve growth factor to make more neural connections. Caffiene & L-Theanine, Noopept, Piracetam, Aniracetam, Choline, CILTEP, etc. Do your own research, but in the past I have taken Noopept (30mcg) and Choline (1000mg) daily recommended dose since they do not need to be cycled. I have additionally taken Aniracetam (1000mg) for an extra boost when needed. Finally, you can take [Modafinil](http://modafinilcat.com) as a two-fold wakefulness and concentration agent. It's pretty powerful.
