{% quote Theodore Roosevelt %}
Whenever you are asked if you can do a job, tell 'em, "Certainly I can!" Then get busy and find out how to do it.
{% endquote %}

I use the [100:10:1 method](/100-10-1) to pick which side projects to work on.

I'm currently working on these side projects:
- [Dunmo](https://github.com/Dunmo/Dunmo)
- [Stockoverflow](https://github.com/jjman505/stockoverflow)
