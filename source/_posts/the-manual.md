Read the fucking manual.

This is my first post.

Each post will be written in an MVP style, where I focus on writing the most important points, then publishing, clarifying later in updates to the post as time allows.

I plan to make this a living blog, which means that each post will maintain it's original permalink and will be linked only by title. The title is unlikely to change, but the content may very well change.

I will keep a commit history on github if you are interested in referencing an old version without using the [internet archives](https://web.archive.org/web/*/jjman505.github.io).

Here are some topics I plan to blog about:
- Productivity systems
- Hacking sleep
- Nutrition
- My influences
- The state of Javascript
- Building web apps in the abstract
- Projects I'm working on
