Read the fucking manual.

This is my first post.

Each post will be written in an MVP style, where I focus on writing the most important points, then publishing, and clarifying later in updates to the post as time allows.

I plan to make this a living blog, which means that the format, content, etc. will change often. This might be terrible for SEO, but I hope it will improve the quality of the blog. Each post is meant to be timeless.

There is a [commit history on github](https://github.com/jjman505/jjman505.github.io) if you are interested in referencing an old version without using the [internet archives](https://web.archive.org/web/*/jjman505.github.io).

Here are some topics I plan to blog about:
- Productivity systems
- Hacking sleep
- Nutrition
- Nootropics
- My influences
- The state of Javascript
- Building web apps in the abstract
- Projects I'm working on
