For side projects, I'm using the [100:10:1 method](/100-10-1).

I use the [Urgency-Importance Matrix](/urgency-importance-matrix) to separate my tasks into four quadrants.

I'm still trying to create a good method for prioritizing quadrant II tasks.

For instance, here's a list of quadrant II tasks:
- Learn [Cerebral](https://github.com/cerebral/cerebral), [Baobab](https://github.com/Yomguithereal/baobab), [Catberry](https://github.com/catberry/catberry), & [Catbee](https://github.com/markuplab/catbee)
- Read _[Never Eat Alone](https://amazon.com/Never-Eat-Alone-Expanded-Updated-ebook/dp/B00H6JBFOS)_
- Create a series of blog posts on Javascript
- Work on [my side projects](/side-projects)
- Read _[The End of Jobs](https://amazon.com/dp/B010L8SYRG) and summarize in blog and/or [goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/50400774-jeremy-meyer).

Is there a magical system I could use to prioritize these things? I could combine the tasks, for instance, starting a new side project using the frameworks listed in the first bullet or making an app to help me decide friends to have lunch with. Either way, I could blog about these things which would naturally grow into a series on Javascript. However, this doesn't help me decide whether to prioritize all that or read _The End of Jobs_. I'm looking into other ways to do this better, especially as part of the product development for [Dunmo](https://github.com/Dunmo/Dunmo).
