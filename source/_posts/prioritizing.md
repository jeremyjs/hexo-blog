For side projects, I'm using the [100:10:1 method](/100-10-1).

I use the [Urgency-Importance Matrix](/urgency-importance-matrix) to separate my tasks into four quadrants.

I'm still trying to create a good method for prioritizing quadrant II tasks.

For instance, here's a list of quadrant II tasks:
- Learn [Cerebral](https://github.com/cerebral/cerebral), [Baobab](https://github.com/Yomguithereal/baobab), [Catberry](https://github.com/catberry/catberry), & [Catbee](https://github.com/markuplab/catbee)
- Read _[Never Eat Alone](https://amazon.com/Never-Eat-Alone-Expanded-Updated-ebook/dp/B00H6JBFOS)_
- Create a series of blog posts on Javascript
- Work on [my side projects](/side-projects)

Is there a magical system I could use to prioritize these things? I don't know yet, but I'm looking into it.
