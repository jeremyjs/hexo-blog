If you spend too much time thinking about a thing, you'll never get it done.

This post explains my own personal productivity system. I will probably break out each section into its own post as it gets more complex. Right now it just lists the apps I use, but I will update it to elaborate how I use them together in my daily workflow.

I use Google Inbox for email. I try to get to inbox zero every day, snoozing emails and reminders as necessary. I like to create reminders for anything that's a task that I won't start until later, or that I don't want to think about until later. (This feature is coming to Dunmo soon).

I use Google Calendar ​for scheduling normal events, planning my day, tracking my time to improve my awareness of how I spend my time, and scheduling regular events to work on recurring tasks (e.g. homework).
​
I use Waffle.io for tracking my work on Dunmo.
​
I use Dunmo (a tool I helped build; still in private Beta) to track and prioritize tasks and know when I might miss deadlines.
​
I use Beeminder when I want to reach a target number of hours doing something.
​
I use Toggl to track time, especially to see how much time is spent on a project or category (like working on a school project or tracking tasks for Beeminder).

I use Productive (iOS app) to track daily habits.
​
I use Workflowy extensively for note taking. It's basically my own personal encyclopedia.

I use Evernote for any notes that have pictures. Namely, I take pictures of all my clothes and keep them in Evernote. I also use it for tracking receipts. After I've captured the receipt I can throw it away. I used to use Evernote for everything, but have since switched to Workflowy and Google Docs for most text notes. I may migrate back to Evernote at some point.

I use Google Docs for taking detailed notes in class.
