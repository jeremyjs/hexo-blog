This post explains my own personal productivity system. I will probably break out each section into its own post as it gets more complex.

Right now, I'm trying to use a biphasic sleep schedule where I take two core sleeps and one nap. I take my first core from 9:30pm-12:30am and my second core from 3:30am-6:00am. I take a 20 minute nap between exercising and lunch. Therefore, my day starts at 6:00am.

First thing after waking, I like to down a glass of orange juice, grab a glass of water, and hop on my computer to plan the day. First, I process my inbox, making note of anything that needs done today. Read more about how I process my inbox [here](/inbox). Ideally this would take no longer than 30 minutes, but depending on the size of my inbox, it may take longer.

I then plan tasks into my day using Dunmo (a tool I helped build; still in private beta) to organize them by priority. I keep a separate list of "fires" which are the highest priority things I must do ASAP. I use Google Calendar ​for scheduling. I like to take a screenshot of my agenda before I start my day, and during the planning session for the next day I like to compare the previous day's screenshot to what actually happened to identify and address any scheduling problems.

I then start my day, tracking my time to improve my awareness of how I spend it. I use Toggl, Google Calendar, and Beeminder for time tracking.
​
I use Productive (iOS app) to track my daily habits. Right now, my daily habits are [Idea Sex](http://www.jamesaltucher.com/2012/04/how-to-have-great-ideas), Inbox Zero, Day Planning, Exercise, Get 20 Minutes of Sunlight, and Meditate.
​
I use Workflowy extensively for note taking. It's basically my own personal encyclopedia. Whenever I have thoughts during the day, come across something interesting on the internet, or want to take notes on a book I'm reading, I put it in Workflowy.

I use Google Docs for taking detailed notes in class.
